# Animatize

Drag a character with your mouse to create an animation

## Demo

Try the demo on [Animatize.com](https://animatize.com/)

## Remix your own animation!

### Two options:

#### 1. Use [the demo](https://animatize.com/) to generate code for your own site

You can generate an animation using your own images and then modify the code there

#### 2. Fork this project

I'd love to see a powerful animation tool that uses a user's natural motion as its foundation.

Feel free to build your own animation service using the code here as proof-of-concept starting point. 

All the code can be found in `js/main.js`

## Animating with natural movement

This idea has been a dream of mine for years. As a web developer, I've never learned After Effects or any other complex animation software.

I've always dreamed of creating interactive demos and animations just by using my natural mouse movements.

So, in early January 2022, [I took a few days off from my main project to create Animatize](https://twitter.com/panphora/status/1478805374455140353), a proof-of-concept showing off the idea that other people could try!
