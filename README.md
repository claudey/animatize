# Animatize

Drag a character with your mouse to create an animation

## Demo

Try the demo on [Animatize.com](https://animatize.com/)

## Remix your own animation!

### Two options:

#### 1. Use the demo to generate code for your own site

You can generate an animation using your own images and then modify the code there

#### 2. Fork this project

I'd love to see a powerful animation tool that uses a user's natural motion as its foundation.

Feel free to build your own animation service using the code here as proof-of-concept starting point. 

All the code can be found in `js/main.js`
